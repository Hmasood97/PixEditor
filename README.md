# PixEditor

This is the final project from my comp 401 class (Foundations of programming.) Here we take in any picture in a certain
resolution size and then manipulate the picture. 

There are three tools: the pixel inspector, paint brush, and blur tool.


Pixel inspector: looks at x and y cooridnates of pixel and tells the rgb values of the pixel


Paint brush: Lets you change the rgb value of pixels with a paint brush size


Blur tool: Supposed to blur out the image but have not completed that yet


You can also add in a new image with the edit a new picture button

(If you are in comp401 now PLEASE DO NOT COPY MY CODE)
