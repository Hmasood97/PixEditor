# PixEditor

This is the final project from my comp 401 class (Foundations of programming.) Here we take in any picture in a certain
resolution size and then manipulate the picture. Manipulate it through changing the size of the paint brush to change the
pixels of the picture. I was not able to finish the blur tool in which you can blur out the picture.
(If you are in comp401 now PLEASE DO NOT COPY MY CODE)
